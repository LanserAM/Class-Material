## Schedule

* Lectures: Mondays, 1-3pm in [RLH 412](http://goo.gl/maps/4c3W)
* Office hours: By appointment


## Course Synopsis

This course is designed to provide students the fundamental skills for effective statistical programming. Students will learn to use R (a statistical programming language) and STATA (a commercial statistics package) for data manipulation, summarization and analysis. Topics will include programming syntax and data structures, generation of scientific graphics, writing functions, debugging and testing, programming paradigms, simulation and optimization. Students will also be introduced to LaTeX and knitr for report writing, version control using Git, and basic SQL programming.

Prerequisites: None

## Grading

Students will be assessed on 4 assignments (50% of grade) and a final exam (50% of grade).


## Assignments

Assignments may be submitted in LaTeX, Sweave, knitr, or any markup format that allows for easy conversion to LaTeX (*e.g.* MultiMarkdown, reStructuredText). Assignments submitted in word processor file formats, including Microsoft Word, will not be accepted. Hand-written assignments (including scanned documents) are also not permitted. Students will be introduced to valid document formats at the beginning of the course.

All assignments will be submitted electronically, via students' private GitHub repositories. Instructions on how to set up and use GitHub accounts will be provided.
