              <p>We would usually like a "paper trail" or a history of the changes that took place in each document, and the ability to roll back changes when necessary. This is particularly important when collaborating on projects with others, when multiple people are editing the same set of documents, data or source code. We need to know who changed what, when they did it, and why. In the absence of a version control system, developers have had to resort to making "backup" copies of entire folders of code each time they made significant changes, or handed it off for collaborators to contribute.</p>

              <p>Git allows you to control and automate how changes are merged, and helps you manage situations when multiple changes are in conflict with one another. While Git can be kept simple, it is also flexible and powerful enough for power users.
Notice that the log of changes looks very much like a journal of the development of the project.</p>

            <header><h3>Git Configuration</h3></header>
            
            
            <section><p>Every time that you interact with Git, it will associate a name and email address with the transaction. Thus, the first step in using Git for the first time is to configure your user name and email.</p>
<pre><code>$ git config --global user.name "Moe Szyslak"
$ git congig --global user.email "moe@moesbar.com"
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a <em>.gitconfig</em> file in your home directory with a very simple structure:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat ~/.gitconfig
  [user]
          name = Moe Szyslak
          email = moe@moesbar.com
</code></pre>
<p>If you ever change your email address, for example, you can either run the command again, or simply edit the <em>.gitconfig</em> file directly. The <em>--global</em> flag indicates that these values are to be applied system-wide; you can override the values for specific projects by running the commands without this flag within the project's directory.</p>
<p>There are a variety of configuration options, but for now, the only other one we will worry about is setting the default text editor. Occasionally you will need to edit files in order to use Git, and this is made easier when your favorite text editor pops up, as needed. You can specify the program you want to associate with Git as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ git config core.editor “C:\Program Files\Accessories\wordpad.exe”
$ git config core.editor mate
$ git config core.editor vim
</code></pre>
<h3>Create a repository</h3>
<p>A local repository can be initialized using Git's <code>init</code> command to create a project folder:</p>
<pre><code>$ git init firstrepo

Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/fonnescj/firstrepo/.git/
</code></pre>
<p>Or, if there is an existing working directory, it can be turned into a repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd firstrepo
$ git init
</code></pre>
<p>Have a look at the <code>.git</code> directory that is created. This is the only thing that Git adds to the file structure.</p>
<p>The <code>git status</code> command is used to monitor the state of the repository and of the working directory.</p>
<pre><code>$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the <code>status</code> command reports that there are no outstanding changes to record. This means that the repository has the same state as that of the working directory.</p>
<p>Committing a new file to our repository (that is, putting the file under the control of Git) is a two-step process. First, we identify a particular file as something we would like to add to our repo:</p>
<pre><code>$ touch model.r
$ git status

# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#   model.r
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
</code></pre>
<p>Creating a file then checking the status of the repo will show that Git is aware of the file, but views it as <em>untracked</em>. Notice that at the bottom of the message, Git gives you a hint about what to do next. Let's do it.</p>
<pre><code>$ git add model.r

# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#   new file:   model.r
#
</code></pre>
<p>This does not commit the file straight away, but rather, puts it in a staging area, where it is ready to be committed alongside other (perhaps related) files. An explicit <code>commit</code> command is then executed to formally give the file membership in the repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ git commit -m "Draft of first model"

[master (root-commit) cace59c] Draft of first model
 0 files changed
 create mode 100644 model.r
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that a commit message has been added, using the <code>-m</code> flag. This message is <em>mandatory</em>, and acts as documentation for that commit. The file <code>new_file.r</code> is now part of the permanent history of the project. Notice also that Git is an "opt-in" system -- you must explicitly specify which files are included in a given commit, rather than having to opt-out files that are committed by default.</p>
<p>Git, unlike many other version control systems, is a distributed system. There is no central or master repository (though you will see the name "master" used as a default repository branch name) that users' copies of the repository must necessarily sync to; each clone of a repo is a first-class version, identical in status to the original.</p>
<p>There is no network activity here. The repo that was created above is a <em>local</em> repository. When we collaborate with others (<em>e.g.</em> on GitHub) we will want to have a common remote repository to coordinate the work of all contributors, but Git can operate entirely offline. Later, whenever it is convenient, our local changes may be shared with a remote repo, if one exists:</p>
<pre><code>$ git push
</code></pre>
<p>We will introduce you to pushing, pulling, and other remote repository interactions a little later.</p>
<p>Git manages files in any particular repository based on the <em>content</em> of those files, rather than superficial changes such as filename, location or file size. For example, if we try making a directory inside the working directory:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir docs
$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
</code></pre>
<p>We see that Git does not take notice of it. This is because Git tracks content. There is no content in an empty directory. What if we <code>touch</code> our file (<code>touch</code> is a UNIX command that changes the access and modification times of a file)?</p>
<pre><code>$ touch model.r
$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
</code></pre>
<p>Again, there is not status change because, again, we have not changed the content of files in the working directory.</p>
<pre><code>$ echo 'library(ggplot2)' &gt;&gt; model.r
$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#   modified:   model.r
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
</code></pre>
<p>Now we have changed the contents of our file, so it appears as <em>modified</em> in Git.</p>
<p>The use of a staging area allows us to be surgical about our commits. In other words, it makes it easier to gather a set of related changes to be committed as a meaningful unit. It also adds a layer of protection from accidentally committing changes that were unintended.</p>
<p>We can add all modified files simultaneously by the syntax:</p>
<pre><code>$ git add .
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this will add only existing files that have been modified. To add new files, or to commit file deletions, we need to add an additional flag:</p>
<pre><code>$ git add -A .
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Exercise: Try renaming a file under version control</strong></p>
<h3>Ignoring, removing and renaming files</h3>
<p>Simply removing a file by throwing it in the trash does not remove it from the repository; it only registers as a modification of the file. We can remove files from the repository using <code>git rm</code>. For example, if we create a new file, and commit it:</p>
<pre><code>$ touch badfile.txt
$ git add badfile.txt
$ git commit -m "Here's a new file"
</code></pre>
<p>The file <code>badfile.txt</code> is now tracked via the repository. If at any stage we want to remove it, you will see that just deleting the file from the file system results in the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ rm badfile.txt
$ git status

# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add/rm &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#   deleted:    badfile.txt
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
</code></pre>
<p>The file does not exist in our working directory any longer, but Git notices that it is gone (notice the message <em>Changes not staged for commit</em>). This message will persist until you tell Git to remove it as well:</p>
<pre><code>$ git rm badfile.txt

rm 'badfile.txt'

$ git status

# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#   deleted:    badfile.txt
#
</code></pre>
<p>Now the change is staged to be committed, and the file will no longer be tracked by the repository (though evidence of its previous existence still appears in the git log). Later, we will show you how to retrieve files deleted from the repository, if you decide later that you need them.</p>
<p>Similar to deleting files, you cannot change the name of a file without doing so through Git. Here's what happens if, rather than deleting <code>badfile.txt</code>, I change its name to <code>goodfile.txt</code> simply by using the UNIX command <code>mv</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ mv badfile.txt goodfile.txt
$ git status

# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add/rm &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#   deleted:    badfile.txt
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#   goodfile.txt
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
</code></pre>
<p>So, as far as Git is concerned, you have deleted <code>badfile.txt</code> and created <code>goodfile.txt</code>, which is currently not tracked. For the change to be propagated as a renaming action, I should have used <code>git mv</code>, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ git mv badfile.txt goodfile.txt
$ git status

# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#   renamed:    badfile.txt -&gt; goodfile.txt
#
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, just because a file exists in your working directory, it does not necessarily imply that you want to track it with the repository. For example, temporary files created by software, program output files, or private content may not be appropriate for tracking. At the same time, we do not want our status messages to be cluttered with files that Git can see but does not track. To prevent particular files (or entire file types) from being tracked by the repository, we can create a <code>.gitignore</code> file (notice the period at the beginning of the filename) that contains a "blacklist" of files that should not be tracked by your repository at any time. As the file name implies, files in this list are simply ignored by Git.</p>
<p>For example, lets create some phony log files in our working directory:</p>
<pre><code>$ touch foo.log bar.log
</code></pre>
<p>If we check the status, these two files will appear in the list of untracked files, but we might be using these to monitor some software development, and so do not want to delete them. Let's create an empty file, and add a single line: <code>*.log</code>. The asterisk is known as a <em>wildcard</em> character, meaning that any filename ending in <code>.log</code> will be ignored by Git. Let's see:</p>
<pre><code>$ git status
# On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#   .gitignore
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the log files now do not appear as untracked files, even though they are still in the working directory, and are not tracked by the repository. </p>
<h2>How Git Works</h2>
<p>Most source control management systems use "deltas" as the unit of storage. That is, rather than storing the entire copies of an original file and its modified version, it simply stores the original file and the <em>difference</em> between the modified file and the original. Thus, to retrieve the current version of the file, the SCM would apply the entire set of differences (often called <em>deltas</em>), essentially re-creating the edits instantaneously. While this seems sensible and economical, since redundant content is not saved with each commit, delta storage gets slower as the history of the file gets longer.</p>
<p>Instead of storing deltas, Git stores directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). A dag is simply a collection of content (binary large objects, or BLOBs), with pointers to that content. These DAGs resemble computer filesystem structures, with files as the content and a directory to locate the content. The savings come from the fact that Git tracks the content of files, which means that identical files are saved only once. Thus, when we rename a file in Git, for example, since only the name of the file is changed, the repository does not make a copy of the file for the new filename, but rather points the new name to the existing content in the repository. Thus, when changes are committed to the repository, only entire new files are added to the repository; therefore, when the current codebase is retrieved, there is no delta calculations to perform. Instead, the DAG corresponding to the current state of the repository is pulled into the current working directory. This makes Git fast, efficient and scalable.</p>
<p>For example, the Ruby on Rails repository (a framework for developing websites and web applications), when it was moved to Git from Subversion, dropped in total size from about 115MB to approximately 13MB. This included every version of every file ever contributed to the project.</p>
<h3>Hashes</h3>
<p>Git identifies the uniqueness of all its content using hashcodes. A hashcode is a mapping of some quantity of data (in our case, the contents of files) to a much smaller dataset that uniquely identifies the original dataset. This is done using one of several <em>hashing algorithms</em>. One typically encounters hashcodes and hashing algorithms in the context of security, but Git uses this relationship to identify the content of files, and hence, to reliably track changes in file content. </p>
<p>In particular, Git uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA1 hashing function</a> to encode the files that it tracks. Using SHA1, a file of arbitrary size is converted into a unique 160-bit string of characters. Even small changes to the corresponding file (e.g. adding a single punctuation mark to an entire book) results in a vastly different hashcode. Everything stored in a Git repository is indexed with its own SHA1 hashcode. To see what I mean, examine the log in any repository:</p>

<p>You can see that each commit in the history is associated with a hashcode.</p>
<h3>Your commit history</h3>
<p>As you have seen above, the <code>git log</code> command accesses the record of all the transactions that have been executed under git for the project from which you call it. Along with the unique commit hash, each entry also contains the name and address of the committer, the date of the commit, as well as the mandatory commit message.</p>
<p>For very large projects, or ones for which you want to quickly scan the commit history, the default output is somewhat verbose. We can use the <em>--pretty</em> (for "pretty-print") argument to change the way the log is displayed. For example, a more compact output, showing just the commit hash and the message, can be obtained by:</p>
<pre><code>$ git log --pretty=oneline

<p>Conversely, a combination of arguments to <code>git log</code> can be used to obtain a highly informative history, as we saw above (using a more realistic repository):</p>

<p>We now see information regarding the various branches, an abbreviated hashcode, and a graph that indicates where code branches were created and merged.</p>
<p>Another powerful use of <code>git log</code> is for filtering the commit history, according to desired criteria. For example, if we want to see all commits from one month ago until yesterday, limiting the number returned to a maximum of 30 records, we can type:</p>
<pre><code>$ git log -n 30 --since='1 month ago' --until=yesterday
