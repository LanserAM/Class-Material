# Cumulative

.notes: Content later in the course builds on what was presented earlier -- keep up!

---

# Hands-on

* Each lecture will be accompanied by hands on exercises
* Homeworks are longer and more involved

# Some R Code

Here is a code block:

	!r
	> diag(c(3,4))
	     [,1] [,2]
	[1,]    3    0
	[2,]    0    4
